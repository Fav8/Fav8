## Hi, I am Leonardo 👋

I am a Fullstack developer 💻 and I like to code in Javascript, I enjoy building software that I actually use in my life like an expenses manager app (⬇ more below...) or a scraper to buy used goods at the best price (coming soon for you to enjoy 😊). If I'm not sitting in a desk coding away, you'll find me reading or going deep in absolutely useless topics until three in the morning 😂.
